# XSS Ninja

**XSSNinja** is a Rust-based tool for automated detection of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in web applications. It scans provided URLs, testing various payloads to identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Features

- **High Concurrency**: Scans multiple URLs simultaneously using Rust's asynchronous features.
- **Diverse Payloads**: Uses a variety of well-known payloads for XSS detection.
- **Smart Parameter Extraction**: Extracts parameters from forms and scripts on the page for more comprehensive testing.
- **GET and POST Modes**: Tests both GET and POST requests.
- **Verbose Mode**: Option to display detailed logs during execution.

## Installation

Ensure Rust is installed on your machine. You can install it via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

Clone the repository and build the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kg1102/xssninja.git
cd xssninja
cargo build --release
```

The compiled binary will be available at `target/release/xssninja`.

## Usage

You can use **xssninja** by providing a list of URLs through a file or via standard input (stdin).

### Example with a file:

```bash
./xssninja -f urls.txt
```

### Example with standard input:

```bash
cat urls.txt | ./xssninja
```

### Specifying concurrency level:

```bash
./xssninja -f urls.txt -c 100
```

### Enabling verbose mode:

```bash
./xssninja -f urls.txt -v
```

## Command-Line Options

```
USAGE:
    xssninja [FLAGS] [OPTIONS]

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information
    -v, --verbose    Activates verbose mode

OPTIONS:
    -c, --concurrency <concurrency>    Sets the level of concurrency [default: 200]
    -f, --file <file>                  Path to the file containing URLs
```

## How It Works

1. **URL Input**: The tool reads URLs to be tested from a file or standard input.
2. **Wordlist Download**: Downloads a wordlist of parameters to increase test coverage.
3. **XSS Scanning**: For each URL:
   - **Initial Analysis**: Makes an initial request to fetch the response body.
   - **Parameter Extraction**: Extracts parameter names from inputs, JavaScript variables, and URLs present in the response.
   - **Payload Testing**:
     - **Existing Parameters**: Tests payloads on the parameters already present in the URL.
     - **Extracted Parameters**: Tests payloads on the parameters extracted from the response body.
     - **Wordlist Parameters**: Tests payloads using parameters from the external wordlist.
   - **XSS Detection**: Checks if injected payloads appear in the response, indicating a potential vulnerability.

4. **Results**: Displays the found vulnerabilities, highlighting confirmed and potential XSS.

## Example Output

```
XSS NINJA - Starting scan...
XSS FOUND (GET): http://example.com/?search=%22%3E%3Csvg%2Fonload%3Dalert(1)%3E
```

- **XSS FOUND**: Confirmed vulnerability.
- **POSSIBLE XSS**: Indicates that the payload might be present in an exploitable context.
- **Sanitized Payload** (Verbose Mode): The payload was filtered by the server.
- **Not Vulnerable** (Verbose Mode): No vulnerabilities detected with the tested payloads.
